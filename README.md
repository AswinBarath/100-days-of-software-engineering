# 100 Days of Software Engineering

- 100 days of software engineering is my goal on working towards the skills I gained in my [Software Engineering Degree](https://github.com/AswinBarath/Software-Engineering-Degree) by:
    - Documenting my course progress
    - Showcasing my skillset
    - Compiling the resources
    - Connecting the dots
    - Ease of access for my future self

## Calendar Progress

- Click the dates to check out the commits
- Progress type:
    - ✅ Consitency
    - ❌ Broke the chain
- 404 Error implies that it's private repository for now, wait till it's made public
